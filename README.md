Brief Intro:

To develop a traceability system that uses QR codes to record and track the lifecycle of raw materials, ensuring transparency, identifying losses at various stages, and optimizing the conversion process from raw material to the final product

Concept Map:
1. First, raw materials arrive, and we enter all the details into the system.  
2. A unique QR code is generated for each material and attached to it.  
3. As the material moves through production stages, the QR code is scanned at every step.  
4. The system saves all the data, like timestamps and location, so we know where the material is and what’s happening to it.  
5. If there’s a delay or gap, the system identifies it, and we can fix it immediately.  
6. Finally, when the product reaches the customer, if there’s a defect, we can trace back the problem using the QR code data.


Tech Stack:

Frontend (User Interface):
HTML CSS JavaScript

Backend :
Python

Database :
MySQL or PostgreSQL

Hosting:
AWS

Hardware:
QR Code Scanner , Printer


Novelties:

Enhanced Traceability: Complete visibility of raw material history and processes.
Loss Identification: Pinpoints where material or process inefficiencies occur.
Improved Quality Control: Ensures consistent product quality by tracking raw material and process history. Sustainability: Minimizes waste and promotes efficient resource usage.
Regulatory Compliance: Simplifies documentation and audit trails for quality certifications.

Solution:

The goal is to create a system that automatically tracks material consumption and reorders materials when stock levels fall below a certain threshold. It should use historical data to predict future material needs and trigger restocks.
